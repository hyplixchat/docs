## Meet The Team
   ### [MCorange](https://github.com/MCorange99)
   - **Frontend**(js)  
       The actual website, making it look nice or at least as good as he can make it.
   
   - **Cli testing tool**(rust)  
       Testing tool for early development. increadibly usefull to find bugs early,
       also can be adapted for a pc app later on.

   - **Hosting**(vps, ubuntu linux)  
       Making use of the free resources by oracle, with pain from the shit ui in oracle cloud panel and the broken default ubuntu install,
       this man can do anything on linux given enough time. While you are reading this 3 minecraft servers, 2 discord bots, like 3 api\`s
       and a bunch of other shit i cant remember are running on his vps. He is the only man that can stop Colderry.

   - **Security**(Hosting)
       while Colderry is making sure the code is secure and without bugs, MCorange is making sure noone can hack the Server,
       hardening the machine, looking out for any ddos atacks.
         
       
  ### [Colderry](https://github.com/colderry)
   - **Backend**(js)  
       The whole brains of the operation, from the rest api to the websockets, made with increadible structure.
       His only weakness is css.

   - **Security**  
       From making sure your messages are safe, stopping weirdos from reading your messages, 
       to fixing simple mistakes like leaving sensitive info in the code. This man is making sure all of us are safe.
